#  Portal - Cross-Device Input and Audio Sharing App

**Portal** is a cross-platform Python application for sharing your mouse, keyboard, clipboard, and audio across multiple devices on the same network. It supports both Linux and Windows.

##  Inspiration

Portal was inspired by tools like [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) and [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy), which pioneered cross-device input sharing.  
This project aims to provide a simpler, Python-based alternative with audio sharing and a customizable GUI.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Seamless Input Sharing**: Mouse & keyboard transition across screens
- **Full Keyboard Support**: All characters including special keys (punctuation, symbols) work in all contexts including password fields and lock screens
- **Bidirectional Clipboard**: Text and images sync automatically when switching controls
- **Audio Streaming**: Share or receive audio between devices
- **Visual Overlay**: See transitions with screen overlay
- **Log Viewer**: GUI-based log viewer for debugging
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows and Linux

##  Requirements

  -  Note: ffmpeg is used internally for capturing and streaming audio across systems. Make sure it's installed and available in your system PATH.

Install Python 3.8+ and then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows-only dependencies:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

### Linux-only packages:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg xclip pactl
# For better keyboard support in secure contexts:
sudo apt install xdotool
```

##  Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use the legacy entry point:
```bash
python portal.py
```

##  Configuration

Update `config.json` or use the GUI to:
- Set Server / Client mode  
- Set audio to Share / Receive  
- Define client direction (Top / Left / Right / Bottom)  
- Enter audio receiver IP

##  Building Executables

###  Windows

Run `build.bat`:

- Output: `dist/Portal-v1.0/Portal-v1.0.exe`

###  Linux

Run `build.sh`:

Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

- Output: `dist/Portal-v1.0/Portal-v1.0`

##  Clean Shutdown

Use the GUI **Stop** button to gracefully stop the app. All subprocesses, sockets, and overlays are properly cleaned up.

# Debugging Stuck Sockets (Windows & Linux)
If the app crashes or is killed without cleanup, you might encounter errors like:

```bash
[Errno 98] Address already in use          # Linux
[WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address is normally permitted  # Windows
```

# Windows: Kill socket process manually
 Find process using all ports (50007,50008,50009)

```bash
netstat -aon | findstr :<PORT>   #replace <PORT>

  TCP    0.0.0.0:<PORT>        0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       <PID>

taskkill /PID <PID> /F     #replace <PID> 
```

# Linux: Kill socket process manually
 Find process using all ports (50007,50008,50009)

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<PORT>    #replace <PORT>

  python3  <PID> user   3u  IPv4  ...  TCP *:<PORT> (LISTEN)

kill -9 <PID>    #replace <PID> 
```
